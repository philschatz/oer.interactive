    <h2>Links to HTML and PDF Examples</h2>
    <p>(fork me on <a href="https://github.com/philschatz/oer.interactive">github</a>!)</p>
    
    <p>In the original <a href="example.cnxml">CNXML</a> file there are a couple of things worth noting:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The CNXML is valid and can be saved/retrieved from the website</li>
      <li>Both the data (CSV or JSON) and the javascrpt code are encoded in attributes that belong to the "data" namespace</li>
      <li>The data can be shared by multiple interactive scripts by moving it up in the XML hierarchy</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once converted into <a href="example.html">HTML</a> there are a few interesting things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>This view is the most dynamic. I've hobbled together a few examples so, mouse over them and have fun!</li>
      <li>There is a bit of scaffolding to load up the contents of the data-script attribute and then make sure it runs in a sandbox</li>
      <li>The HTML generated by cnxml2html5 is getting closer to matching the output of Docbook</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The <a href="example.pdf">PDF</a> illustrates the end-goal of having the "interactive" elements rendered in a sane static way for print. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Bezier example is paused at a "useful" timestep that shows off a lot of properties of the curve</li>
      <li>The Tangle example has valid values stored in all of the autogenerated slots so the text is readable</li>
      <li>The Bar graph shows the non-drilled-down chart</li>
      <li>All of the Math has rendered before the HTML snapshot was taken</li>
      <li>The labels on the doughnuts are not labeled becuase PrinceXML does not support text rendered on a curve</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Also, in working on this I noticed that in our books the only things that were dependent on other chapters/sections were numbering and links. These HTML files (modules) can be generated upon publish and the collection PDFs and EPUBs only need to apply the CSS logic on the whole book, not anything covered in this project</p>
